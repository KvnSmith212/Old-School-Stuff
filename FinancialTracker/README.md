FinancialTracker
================

This is a financial tracking application (Android) created for CS2340, Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I did most of the coding, with some help towards the middle-end from another group member.

Status: Finished but highly unpolished with some nonworking features. I wanted to go through, clean up the UI, clean up some of the code my other group member wrote, etc but just never had the time or desire. The project is enough to get the grade and I have other projects/classes I'm more interested in.
