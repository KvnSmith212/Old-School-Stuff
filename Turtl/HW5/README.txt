TURTL v1.0.0

So basically, this is Snake with a turtle for the background. Eat the
food (larger squares, because why not) to grow larger and larger and larger, 
until you hit your tail. If you eat your tail (why????) you lose and must 
restart. Don't eat your tail. If you run into the wall, you will be forced 
to turn around. If you just started, this isn't a problem. But if you have a tail
larger then 1 foods worth, you will run into your tail, eat it, and lose.
There is no winning scenerio, you can ONLY LOSE. Good luck.

Controls:
Arrow keys move you up, dont, left, and right.
Space starts the game, pauses, and resets your snake when you lose.

NOTE: This is a game I made for a school project. It is intended for use with the raspberry pi and adafruit lcd screen. Also, not all of this code is mine. I was given an existing codebase to work with and expand upon, so while most/all of the game logic is mine, some of the other stuff is not.

Status: finished
