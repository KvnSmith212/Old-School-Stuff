Project 3: The Jacobi Algorithm


Here you can find the entire project as well as a runnable jar. If for some reason the jar doesn't work, the project can be easily imported into eclipse. Run JacobiApp.java and you should have no problem getting things working. However, that should not be necessary.

Windows: Just double click Jacobi.jar and it should start up no problem, as long as Java 6 or greater is installed.

Linux: Navigate via the terminal to the project folder and run the file OR right click on the jar and run it using Java 6 or greater.

I've tested on Ubuntu and windows and both worked well. With ubuntu I did have to set it to executable first by rightclicking the jar --> properties --> permissions --> check allow executing file as program.

If you can't get things to run, please email me at kvnsmith212@gmail.com and I can clear up any issues or we can set up a demo time.
